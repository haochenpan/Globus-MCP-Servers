# Science MCPs

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable Claude and other AI assistants to interact with scientific computing resources and data management services.

## Overview

This repository contains MCP servers that allow AI assistants to interact with scientific computing infrastructure:

1. **Globus MCP Servers** - Enable interaction with Globus services for data transfer and compute functions
2. **Compute Facility MCP Servers** - Enable interaction with ALCF and NERSC supercomputing facilities
3. **Diaspora MCP Server** - Enables interaction with the Diaspora Event Fabric (Octopus) for topic management and event streaming.

These servers implement the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/mcp), which allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with external tools and services.

## Components

### Globus MCP Servers

The Globus MCP servers enable AI assistants to:

- **Globus Transfer** - Transfer files between Globus endpoints, browse directories, and manage transfer tasks
- **Globus Compute** - Register and execute Python functions on remote Globus Compute endpoints (formerly FuncX)

[Learn more about Globus MCP Servers](mcps/globus/README.md)

### Compute Facility MCP Servers

The Compute Facility MCP servers enable AI assistants to:

- **ALCF** - Check status of ALCF machines (e.g., Polaris) and monitor running jobs
- **NERSC** - Check status of NERSC systems and services

### Diaspora MCP Server

The Diaspora MCP server enable AI assistants to:

- **Manage topics** - Create, list, and delete topics within the user’s namespace
- **Stream events** - Publish events to a topic and retrieve the most recent event

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Claude Desktop application
- For Globus servers: A Globus account and Client ID

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/globus-labs/science-mcps
   cd science-mcps
   ```

2. Create a conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n science-mcps python=3.11
   conda activate science-mcps
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies for the specific MCP server you want to use:
   ```bash
   # For Globus servers
   pip install -r mcps/globus/requirements.txt
   
   # For Compute Facility servers
   pip install -r mcps/compute-facilities/requirements.txt

   # For Diaspora server
   pip install -r mcps/diaspora/requirements.txt
   ```

## Setting up MCP Servers in Claude Desktop

To add these MCP servers to Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings (gear icon)
3. Navigate to the "MCP Servers" section
4. Click "Add Server"
5. Configure each server as needed

For detailed configuration instructions, see the README files for each component:
- [Globus MCP Servers Setup](mcps/globus/README.md#setting-up-mcp-servers-in-claude-desktop)
- [Compute Facility MCP Servers Setup](mcps/compute-facilities/READEME.md#setting-up-mcp-servers-in-claude-desktop)
- [Diaspora MCP Server Setup](mcps/diaspora/README.md#setting-up-the-mcp-server-in-claude-desktop)

## Usage Examples

### Globus Transfer

You can ask Claude to:
```
Transfer files from my Globus endpoint to another endpoint
```

### Globus Compute

You can ask Claude to:
```
Run a Python function on a Globus Compute endpoint
```

### ALCF Status

You can ask Claude to:
```
Check if Polaris is online
```

### NERSC Status

You can ask Claude to:
```
Check the status of NERSC systems
```

### Diaspora Event Fabric

You can ask Claude to:
```
register a topic, produce three messages, and receive the latest message
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Problems**: Check that you have network access to the required services
- **Permission Errors**: Verify you have the necessary permissions for the endpoints you're trying to access
- **Server Not Found**: Ensure the path to the Python scripts in Claude Desktop configuration is correct
